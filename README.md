# myMovies Movie App üçø

## Overview

The "myMovies" application is a full-stack JavaScript project built as part of CareerFoundry's Full-Stack Web Development Course. It is designed to demonstrate the mastery of MERN stack development.

The server-side component of the application includes a REST API and a MongoDB database, built using Node.js, Express, and JavaScript. The REST API can be accessed using common HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform CRUD operations on the database.

The client-side component of the application is built using React, providing users with access to information about movies, directors, and genres. More detailed information about the features provided by the application can be found in the "Features" section of this README.
